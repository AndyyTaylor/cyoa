**To run the game**
I think you can just *cd* into this directory then type *./out* but if it doesn't work let me know.

**To play**
WASD to move
Mouse to look around
ESC to exit

Yes the game does grab your mouse, no there's no way to release the mouse mid game (sorry!)

**A few quick notes**
- The make.sh was just something I created that could be run from terminal to build the game
- In conjunction with *while true; do fswatch --one-event ~/google\ drive/c++/cyoa && sh ~/google\ drive/c++/cyoa/make.sh; done* it would automatically build it when I changed anything

- sfml doesn't play nice with mac and mouse.. don't be rough with the mouse inputs :)
- and I couldn't see any possible reason to have to press more than 1 key at once :)
